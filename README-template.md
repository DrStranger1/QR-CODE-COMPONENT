## Overview

The challenge is quite good for absolute beginners and some point it helps realize the gap between theory and practical aspects of designing, that is to say things are not as easy as they seem to be in theory ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„. 
With the help of several online referrences, it took me an average of 3 days to complete this to my best. I have encountered several challenges, some of which i have not managed to sort out and i expect to learn more from others' feedbacks. 
thank you.
